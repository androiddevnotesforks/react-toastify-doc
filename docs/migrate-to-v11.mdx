## What is new in v11

I‚Äôm super excited about this release! The main focus was on customization, and my goal was to empower you (and myself) so you can fully personalize the look and feel for the notifications.

In short, react-toastify should be able to blend in any design system.

![customization FTW](./customization.png)

### No need to import the css file anymore

The stylesheet is now injected automatically, so you no longer need to import it. The CSS file is still exported by the library.

```tsx
  import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify';

  function App(){
    const notify = () => toast("Wow so easy !");

    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={notify}>Notify !</button>
        <ToastContainer />
      </div>
    );
  }
````

### Easy customization!

One of the top requests has been how to customize notifications. To be fair, until this release, it was quite challenging because it required users to override numerous CSS classes.

I‚Äôve simplified the DOM structure of the notification by removing extraneous div elements, nested elements, etc... It‚Äôs a significant breaking change, but it‚Äôs truly worth the effort. I can confidently say that the library can now seamlessly integrate into any design system.

Below, I‚Äôve implemented a couple of different designs using only Tailwind. **I didn‚Äôt override a single CSS class from react-toastify ü§Ø!**

How does it work in practice? On the left side, we have the old DOM structure vs the new one on the right side.

![structure](./noti-struct.png)

- `Toastify__toast-body` and its child are now completely gone.
- The `CloseButton` now uses an absolute position.

Thanks to those changes, **nothing will interfere with your content.**

`Toastify__toast` has some sensible default values(e.g., border-radius, shadow, etc...) that can be customized using css or by updating the associated css variables:

```css
width: var(--toastify-toast-width);
min-height: var(--toastify-toast-min-height);
padding: var(--toastify-toast-padding);
border-radius: var(--toastify-toast-bd-radius);
box-shadow: var(--toastify-toast-shadow);
max-height: var(--toastify-toast-max-height);
font-family: var(--toastify-font-family);
```

### Custom progress bar

Allowing a custom progress bar wasn‚Äôt on my to-do list at all while working on this release. But seeing how easy it is to customize notifications now, I couldn‚Äôt resist üòÜ.

The best part is that you don‚Äôt have to compromise on features like `autoClose`, `pauseOnHover`,` pauseOnFocusLoss`, or even a controlled progress bar‚Äîit just works seamlessly for you.

<Embed url="https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-toastify-custom-progress-bar" />

Here is a small gist.

```tsx
function App() {
  const notify = () => {
    toast(CustomComponent, {
      autoClose: 8000,
      // removes the built-in progress bar
      customProgressBar: true
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={notify}>notify</button>
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  );
}

// isPaused is now available in your component
// it tells you when to pause the animation: pauseOnHover, pauseOnFocusLoss etc...
function CustomComponent({ isPaused, closeToast }: ToastContentProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <span>Hello</span>
      <MyCustomProgressBar isPaused={isPaused} onAnimationEnd={() => closeToast()} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Accessibility and keyboard navigation

`ToastContainer` and `toast` accept an `ariaLabel` prop(finally...). This is quite helpful for screen readers and also for testing.
For example, in cypress you could do `cy.findByRole("alert", {name: "the aria label you specified"})`.

```tsx
toast("hello", {
  ariaLabel: "something"
})
```

If a notification is visible and the user presses `alt+t` it will focus on the first notification allowing the user to use `Tab` to navigate through the different elements within the notification.

The `hotKeys` can be changed of course.

```tsx
// focus when user presses ‚åò + F
const matchShortcut = (e: KeyboardEvent) => e.metaKey && e.key === 'f'

<ToastContainer hotKeys={matchShortcut} ariaLabel="Notifications ‚åò + F" />
```

### Notification removal reason with onClose callback

Do you want to know whether the user closed the notification or if it closed automatically? Rest assured, this is now possible!

The signature of the `onClose` callback is now `onClose(reason?: boolean | string) => void`.

When the user closes the notification, the `reason` argument is equal to `true`. In the example below, I've named my argument
`removedByUser` to make the intent clear.

```tsx
toast("hello", {
  onClose(removedByUser){
    if(removedByUser) {
      // do something
      return
    }

    // auto close do something else
  }
})
```

If you are using a custom component for your notification, you might want more control over the reason, especially if it contains
multiple call to actions.

```tsx
import { ToastContentProps } from "react-toastify";

function CustomNotification({closeToast}: ToastContentProps) {
  return <div>
      You received a new message
      <button onClick={() => closeToast("reply")}>Reply</button>
      <button onClick={() => closeToast("ignore")}>Ignore</button>
    </div>
}

toast(CustomNotification, {
  onClose(reason){
    switch (reason) {
      case "reply":
        // navigate to reply page for example or open a dialog
      case "ignore":
        // tell the other user that she/he was ghosted xD
      default:
        // ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    }
  }
})
```

## üí• Breaking Changes

### useToastContainer and useToast no longer exposed

Those hooks are unusable unless you deep dive in react-toastify source code to understand how to glue things together. This is not what I want for my users, it was a bad decision to expose them in the first place, I've learned a good lesson.

### onClose and onOpen no longer receive children props

In hindsight, I should never have done this. The feature is practically not used. Below the new signature for each callback:

- `onOpen: () => void`
- `onClose: (reason?: boolean | string) => void`

### Styling

- `react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.minimal.css` has been removed.
- Scss is out of the picture now. The library uses good old css.
- `bodyClassName` and `bodyStyle` are no longer needed.
- `progressBarStyle` in order to reduce the api surface. They are now better way to customize everything without relying on inline style.
- `injectStyle` has been removed. This function is no longer needed.
- The css class `Toastify__toast-body` and its direct child have been removed.
